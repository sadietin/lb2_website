            MIND ON FIRE: THE LIFE OF JACOB BOEHME by Wayne Kraus
            “His bodily Presence was mean, his Stature small, his Forehead low, his Temples prominent, his Nose aquiline, his Eyes grey and rather of an AzureCast, bright and clear, like the Windows of Solomon's Temple; his Beard was short and thin; And altho' the Tone of his Voice was low, yet he was mild and affable in his Discourse; modest in his Dep ortment, discreet and judicious in his Words, humble in his Walk and Conversation, patient in Sufferings; also meek and lowly in Heart: His Spirit, so highly illuminated of God beyond any Thing Nature could produce, and his extremely pure and very intelligible Style, according to the highest and best German Standard, are left to the Reader's Sagacity to examine and recognize in the divine Light, by these his unsophisticated Writings.” (Frankenberg)


            He was born in 1575, April 24th, at the village of Alt Seidenberg in Upper Lusatia, a mile from the city of Gorlitz. Though the village was poor, it had a schoolhouse where Jacob received a basic education. His father was a peasant landowner, an elder in the church, and had enough financial wherewithal to apprentice his son to a shoemaker.
            Says Frankenberg: “According to the blessed Man's own Narrative made to myself, it fell out on a certain Time during his Apprenticeship, that a Stranger, plain and mean indeed in his Dress, but otherwise of a good and respectable Presence, comes to the Shop, and asks to buy a Pair of Shoes: But as neither Master nor Mistress were within, he, JACOB BEHMEN, the Prentice-Boy, would not venture to sell them, till the Stranger, with much Importunity, insisted upon his letting him have them: Now, then, he having more of a Mind to put the Buyer off than to sell the Shoes, set a somewhat enormous unequitable Price upon them. The Man however paid down the Money demanded without the least Demur or Objection; and, taking up the Shoes, went away.
            “But being got at some small Distance from the Shop, and then stopping short, he called out, with an audible and serious Tone of Voice, 'Jacob, come out hither to me.' An Address like this from a Person unknown, and made by his Christian Name too, startled the Boy; but, upon recovering himself again, he got up and went out into the Street to him. The Man then, whose Mien was serious and loving, with sparkling Eyes, taking him by the right Hand, and looking him full in the Face, said, 'JACOB, thou art little, but thou shalt become great, and a Man so very different from the common Cast, that thou shalt be the Wonder of the World. Be therefore a good Lad; fear God, and reverence his Word: Let it especially be thy Delight to read the Holy Scripture, wherein thou art furnished with Comfort and Instruction; for thou shalt be obliged to suffer a great deal of Affliction, Poverty, and Persecution also: Nevertheless be thou of good Comfort, and firmly persevere, for God loveth thee, and he is gracious unto thee!'
            “Upon which the Man, after squeezing him by the Hand, and looking him full in the Face, went of Course his own Way.”...

                  Jacob Boehme’s writings opened this whole new world of depth revelation to (William) Law. Law is really the expositor in simpler form of Boehme’s glowing, but sometimes almost unintelligible, outpourings. Jacob Boehme is, of course, acknowledged by all the great investigators of truth—scientists (Sir Isaac Newton owned some of his basic concepts on gravity to Boehme), philosophers, theologians—as one of the greatest “seers” of all time, yet always with the Scriptures as his ultimate source.  I must admit I have received more pure light from a few sayings of Boehme that from whole books by other authors.  However, he is difficult to understand and much goes beyond me, whereas anyone can read William Law, though there again it took time for me to soak into his glorious presentation of God “the eternal will to all goodness,” to the depth understanding of the Fall, wrath, atonement, and the total meaning of the new birth.  You may not find it easy to follow through, even with this <emphasis>Wholly for God</emphasis>, but oh what riches if you do! In William Law, Jacob Boehme, and some others, for me “the winter is passed; the time of the singing of the birds had come.”<br>
