                  Dear Mr. Watson, Yes, I am rejoicingly a <em> Panentheist*,</em> (not a pantheist, for only those still in Rom. 1:25 can be that, to whom God is not a person, but a thing). But I see the Transcendent in the Immanent, God “All in all” – Omniscient, Omnipresent, Omnipotent – within as well as without, where all is really one to the eye of faith (Eph. 1:10). I have written on this in several books such as SPONTANEOUS YOU and WHO AM I. <br>What is a “Personality Cult”? Is your Seminary that because the name of your seminary includes the names of two of your founders, or are all Lutherans that, or Wesleyans, or Moody Bible Institute, or Oral Roberts University, or Bob Jones? What about Paul in Corinthians 4:16 where he says “Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me?” We at WEC are often called “The C. T. Studd Mission”! I am honoured if any have seen more of the Lord by my writings, even if temporarily they might be caught up in 1 Corinthians 1:12 name calling (“I am of Paul; and I am of Apollos,” etc.) As to being “asked to resign from WEC”, it is my joy to be listed in our British WORLDWIDE Magazine as “International Secretary Emeritus” (that was entirely the doing of our British Staff after I had resigned by my own choice and guidance at 70 years of age). In the printed list of our USA Headquarters workers (31 names listed), they have graciously still listed me next after our U.S.A. Secretary, Elwin Palmer, although I am long retired, an honour they don’t give to other retirees. At our last International Leaders Conference in 1974 they gave me a special invitation to be with them and give the opening talk.<br><br>
                  Respectfully, Norman Grubb <br><br>

                  <strong>Activating the Holy Spirit is accomplished the same as when they asked Jesus: “Then how do we work the works of God?” to which he replied: “Believe on Him whom He hath sent.” That believing meant to acknowledge and say the truth about His risen life in me. When I found out that (my) works were DEAD works I cried out with Paul in Romans 7 when He said: "When I TRY to do good, EVIL is present with me, “WHO will deliver me from this death?" The deadly doctrines that began the self-help craze back in the 70's has absolutely paralyzed the body of Christ. We were asked to ‘BE LIKE Jesus’...which was and is folly! The Holy Spirit revealed two things to me; first...that I was hopeless and needed a Savior....second....that I was helpless and needed the risen Holy Spirit to ‘cause’ me to walk in His Way! That day, I was freed to walk by faith in HIS POWER and not my own and since that day, I have never looked back. All the bridges of self-effort were burned and I now walk the high road of knowing that His Holy Spirit is living and having His Being as me! Gal. 2:20 and Col. 1:27. “Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My Way!” Ezekiel 36:26, 27. Linda Bunting
