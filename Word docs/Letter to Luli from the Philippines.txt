Letter to Luli from the Philippines:

Luli, your letter arrived today. It took 3 months, but so nice to see your own handwriting (in the address), as that’s become so rare these days—words personalized by our own bodies that carry unique power in them to others, especially in a day where physical contact is eschewed. Today I celebrate our bodies’ unique ability to express the Spirit, both in the message we convey and in the special sense of “bodies washed with pure water” bringing light and holiness to others. When you’re truly holy, then everything you touch becomes holy, and I just wanted you to know that your Holy Spirit temple showed up here today, full of Spirit and Power.
