\f0\fs24 \cf0 During the years of John\'92s life, influences of going to the mission field was strongly discussed in our Christian Circles. The Seed of that thought , to take the message of Galatians 2:20 and Col. 1:24 to Africa stayed with John all through the journey of his thriving surgery career. At one point it grew so strong that it sent him to visit Norman Grubb. When John said to him: \'93 Norman , have I missed something?\'94 Norman\'92s reply was this, \'93 JOHN, DON\'92T TOUCH IT. WHEN IT IS OF THE SPIRIT YOU WON\'92T BE ABLE TO NOT DO IT.\'94 It was brilliant insight because in due time  John heard the \'91call\'92  to lay down his life here and his answer could be none other than \'93HERE I AM , SEND ME.}
