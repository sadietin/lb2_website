Pentecost, that supreme event in human history, where The risen and glorified Christ sends forth his Holy Spirit to inhabit the lives of the redeemed

to cause us to be what we were created to be and could not be without


With deep respect for our bonds in Christ and the Holy Spirit's revelation of Himself: "Christ in you."

He who believes in me,ut of his innermost being shall flow riers of living water.


O inestimable Truths! precious Mysteries, of the Love of God, enough to split the hardest Rock of the most obdurate Heart, that is but able to receive one Glimpse of them!


Do you see, beloved, the eleventh hour has struck, and floods of light are emanating from the very presence of the Kingdom...

Be still. Let Me reveal Myself. Let Me tell you something. Let Me fill you with the Spirit of Fire and Water, and let Me send you forth into expression, a burning flame of revelation and a thirst-quenching fountain of life. You!
