                 <!-- this is from DeeDee's Hearts Set Free book, back cover -->
                 Norman Percy Grubb was the son of an English clergyman. He married Pauline Studd Grubb, daughter of C.T. Studd, the founder of the Heart of Africa Mission which became Worldwide Evangelization Crusade. After C.T.'s death Norman became General Secretary and traveled extensively developing the Mission and its outreach to bring Christ to unevangelized peoples. He retired as International Secretary in 1965.<br> 
                 In 1920 when Norman was a new missionary to the Congo, God gave him fresh insight to the Scriptures and His Being that set the course for the rest of his life. Norman had given his all to bring Jesus to the Africans, but soon found himself deeply disturbed because he feared he was bringing them just another set of rules and doctrines. He also faced the aching reality, that no matter how he tried, he could not love the African.<br>  
                 After much anguish, one day the Holy Spirit impressed upon him, “God is love.” God then said to him that He would not give Norman love, but that He would be love in him. At the same time God revealed to him Galatians 2:20 …“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me and the life I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who gave Himself for me.”1 Norman then knew it was not his love, not his faith and not his life! <br>  
                 From then on, Norman called himself “a fiddle with one string” writing and speaking about our oneness and union with Christ. In his autobiography “Once Caught, No Escape” Norman says, “…there has been for me a vital difference between the second experience of discovering Christ living in me, and this third revelation of Christ all in all. The second experience left gaps where I did not yet see Him in everything everywhere, and all a form of Him, whether negatively of Him in wrath, or positively of Him in grace as light; and so there were separations, and callings on Him to be this or do that, in place of affirming that He is in fullness of His action everywhere…to be settled into this union which is unity, I had to go through a ‘dark night of the soul' which affected no outward things, but the very inward vitals of my ‘I and Thou' consciousness.” His oft written word of encouragement in signing his books was “Not God and &mdash; but God only.”<br>
                 Norman Grubb spent his life sharing these truths with anyone who would invite him into their home or church and also in writing countless books, pamphlets and letters about Galatians 2:20…our lives being lived by the One who gave Himself for us. 
                 With many great men of the Bible in their latterii years, when their life's work seemed over, God had a new work…and it was so for Norman. He called it “God's redirection” in order that he might bring Paul's “mystery of the gospel, Christ in you, the hope of glory” to many he could not reach through W.E.C. Norman heard his ‘Homecall' at 98 years of age on December 15, 1993. He is buried in Philadelphia next to his beloved wife, Pauline.<br>  
                 And from Norman's final letter shortly before his “Homecall”… “By faith may you find the answers that the Lord has for you. May you always walk in faith until we meet in the glory of God.” <br>

                  <emphasis>There is only one Cross, a glorious historic Cross; </emphasis>only one Christ, an historic Christ; only one death, an historic death which he accomplished for me. But being my substitute, in fact if I am a believer, it was I there on the Cross. So I lean back on an accomplished fact. I reckon on the fact of my co-crucifixion and co-resurrection with my Lord Jesus Christ. The co-resurrection, of course, being by Another. The resurrection wasn't by the ability of Christ to rise from the dead;, because in infinite grace, taking our place as a man, He gave up His right to rise. He was a dead body. Another raised him from the dead, as Another comes and raises us from the dead; that indwelling Person of Romans 8. Thus we enter into Galatians 2:20. Now I am a crucified person so far as that independent ego is concerned. I am alive, so far as that little bit of an ego in which I was created is concerned. Inside that lives The Ego, the Self of all selves—Christ within. Now I live my life. 
                  <br>
                  Let us get this one thing straight; this is not that old confusing and mistaken idea that we humans are possessors of two natures and in a struggle between them, dog eating dog. This is the error, which puts us into the continuous condemnation of “we ought to be different.” Cut the words “ought to” out of our vocabulary. They belong to the law, which says you ought, and the law He has “taken out of the way, nailing it to His cross,” and has “abolished in His flesh the enmity, the law of commandments contained in ordinances.” Negatives are the opposite ends of their respective positives. So, we humans have not natures of our own, but we express the nature of the one who lives in us. Of old, as the old man, we expressed the nature of “the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience” so that we were “by nature the children of wrath” according to Ephesians 2:2-3.  As the new man is Christ, we are “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4), which is the Spirit of God bearing His own good fruit by us.
                  <br>  
                  Our confusion may be because I may feel it is all very well to talk of Christ living in me, but in practical fact, far more of me shows up than of Him! And it is all very well to say I was once a partaker of the satanic nature of self-centeredness and expressed him; but now I am a partaker of the divine nature and express Christ. But do I? I have put off the old man and put on the new, it seems to me lots of the old man is still very evident! But that is where we need to get this “two nature” question sorted out, and this old man-new man syndrome.
                  <br>  
                  The confusion is between center and circumference. The center is the set of our lives; the circumference is what may temporarily influence us. In our old life, in “the old man,” our center was fixed, we being owned of the devil. We were slaves to him, Paul said in Romans 6:6-22. Now a slave is the property of his master; but no one can take from him his basic freedom. So, we may imagine a slave serving his master all day, then when his master is away somewhere at night, the salve well exercise his freedom by a visit to the market. He still remains a slave, but just goes his own way for a short while and returns to where he belongs.
                  <br>   
                  So now a slave of Satan can go and do a few good and religious things for a time, but that doesn't change has basic slavery so equally a slave of Jesus can be tempted to exercise his human freedom in the ways of the flesh and does so, but back he comes to whom He belongs.
                  <br>
                  <br>   
                  <strong>We are what we are at our center, and our nature is the nature of the one who lives in us at the center. </strong> A temporary deviation does not alter that basic nature, but is just a diversion. When at the new birth Christ becomes our fixed center, we have begun to express His divine nature, though we may and so deviate into the flesh: but that does not alter the center. So just as a slave of the devil can do a few good things occasionally return to whom he belong, a slave of Christ can do a few bad things and return to whom he belongs. Do not mistake a deviation for a nature. We can never have two natures at once. Impossible. We are always pure at the center, in the sense of the word meaning unmixed. We were unmixed in our heart allegiance to Satan; thank God we are not unmixed in our allegiance to Christ. You cannot have a double mind or a double tongue (as James said of a fountain not being able to ‘send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter'). We have a single mind or tongue, but it can be temporarily diverted.  Call that double, if you like, but basically it is single.

                  <strong> Cleanse means to remove the consciousness of a thing. And you're free to serve...from dead works to serving the Living God. We're not free to serve while we're in bondage to our guilt or condemnation. The completion of our liberation and setting of us in the eternal union relationship is first of all the recognition that there is this union provided in the covenant which has been sealed to us in our great High Priest. Then we're to be undisturbed in that covenant. There's no further guilt or condemnation...and even when we slip into something which might produce guilt or condemnation, we move in and say it's not there. We move back into where we're free to serve, because we're free!

                  There is a great deal of false condemnation. We mistake the temptations we all have for actual sin...and thus feel condemned. James clears that in 1:14-15. In Christ, as new creations, we accept ourselves delivered from that old sin-Satan indweller, and he replaced by our Christ-indweller. We are actually "made the righteousness of God in Him." (2 Cor. 5:21) But as only tempted and pressured selves, we do not mistake such soul-body assaults on us as sins committed producing condemnation. No, they are spurs to faith in our Christ-indweller and keeper! Sins are only (as in that James 1:15) when, from our spirit-center &mdash our heart &mdash we purposely follow a temptation into a committed sin, which is really rather rare. But, even then we are in temporary guilt, but not in condemnation. We are honest. We walk in the light...confess...agree with God about the sin committed. But when we have done that, John says, "He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" &mdash consciousness of sin, and that is what it is here saying in 9:14, our consciences are cleansed from those "dead works". The precious blood has already blotted out the sins, but also now it cleanses from continued sense of condemnation. We do not live in condemnation! "There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." (Rom. 8:1) We walk free and continue to walk free!
                    
                  The final of these four chapters (chapters 7-10) of our heavenly dimension in Christ is by the Intercessor &mdash the restoration of the whole man in God. His shed blood removed the sins and their guilt consequences &mdash "dead to sin" (1 Pet. 2:24). The offering of the body of Christ, His body representing us, was "made sin" (2 Cor. 5:2), just as ours contained the sin-indweller from the Fall; and in His body-death, as us, out went that sin-spirit of error and thus out of us, and in His resurrection in came His own "Spirit of Truth," and thus into us. So it now says, "We are sanctified (made holy, made whole) through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." "By one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified." Now that's the whole man &mdash the whole spirit, soul and body &mdash perfectly God's perfect agent. So we're to see ourselves as perfect! The whole of us is caught up and transformed in the offering of the blood and the offering of the body. The whole man is back into its relationship in which we were created &mdash to be sons with the Son.<br>
