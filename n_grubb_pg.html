            <!-- this is from DeeDee's Hearts Set Free book, back cover -->
            Norman Percy Grubb was the son of an English clergyman. He married Pauline Studd Grubb, daughter of C.T. Studd, the founder the Heart of Africa Mission which became Worldwide Evangelization Crusade. After C.T.’s death Norman became General Secretary and traveled extensively developing the Mission and its outreach to bring Christ to unevangelized peoples. He retired as International Secretary in 1965. 
            In 1920 when Norman was a new missionary to the Congo, God gave him fresh insight to the Scriptures and His Being that set the course for the rest of his life. Norman had given his all to bring Jesus to the Africans, but soon found himself deeply disturbed because he feared he was bringing them just another set of rules and doctrines. He also faced the aching reality, that no matter how he tried, he could not love the African. 
            After much anguish, one day the Holy Spirit impressed upon him, “God is love.” God then said to him that He would not give Norman love, but that He would be love in him. At the same time God revealed to him Galatians 2:20 …“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me and the life I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who gave Himself for me.”1 Norman then knew it was not his love, not his faith and not his life! 
            Norman called himself “a fiddle with one string” writing and speaking about our oneness and union with Christ. In his autobiography “Once Caught, No Escape” Norman says, “…there has been for me a vital difference between the second experience of discovering Christ living in me, and this third revelation of Christ all in all. The second experience left gaps where I did not yet see Him in everything everywhere, and all a form of Him, whether negatively of Him in wrath, or positively of Him in grace as light; and so there were separations, and callings on Him to be this or do that, in place of affirming that He is in fullness of His action everywhere…to be settled into this union which is unity, I had to go through a ‘dark night of the soul’ which affected no outward things, but the very inward vitals of my ‘I and Thou’ consciousness.” His oft written word of encouragement in signing his books was “Not God and &mdash; but God only.”
            Norman Grubb spent his life sharing these truths with anyone who would invite him into their home or church and also in writing countless books, pamphlets and letters about Galatians 2:20…our lives being lived by the One who gave Himself for us. 
            With many great men of the Bible in their latterii years, when their life’s work seemed over, God had a new work…and it was so for Norman. He called it “God’s redirection” in order that he might bring Paul’s “mystery of the gospel, Christ in you, the hope of glory” to many he could not reach through W.E.C. Norman heard his ‘Homecall’ at 98 years of age on December 15, 1993. He is buried in Philadelphia next to his beloved wife, Pauline. 
            And from Norman’s final letter shortly before his “Homecall”… “By faith may you find the answers that the Lord has for you. May you always walk in faith until we meet in the glory of God.” <br>
