                 <!-- this is from Wayne Kraus's website -->
            WILLIAM LAW (1686-1761) was an Anglican clergyman, barred from the pulpit for refusing an oath of allegiance to King George the First. He served as tutor to the historian Edward Gibbon, who spoke highly of Law despite the latter's admiration for “the incomprehensible visions of Jacob Behmen.”
            
            Law was not the first Englishman to discover Jacob Boehme. The German theosopher was already known to Dissenters like the Quakers and various “Behmenist” societies such as the Philadelphians. But he probably has done more than any other to promote Boehme in the English-speaking world, and was himself a penetrating mystic and masterful stylist. 

            "<i>A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</i>" was and unfortunately remains Wiliam Law's most popular work. But, while the book established his reputation as a master of English prose, it is, frankly, the worst kind of priestcraft. Norman Grubb, a great admirer of Law, explains, “Law was at that time a legalistic idealist, knowing nothing of grace through faith, and in that stage of experience wrote his best-known book, A Serious Call, which is straight Christian standards of living with no inkling of how to live them.”

            Around the age of fifty Law discovered the works of Jacob Boehme and his High Church religion was shaken to the ground.

            “When I first began to read Behmen’s book, it put me into a perfect sweat. But as I discerned sound truths and the glimmering of a deep ground and sense even in the passages not then clearly intelligible to me, and found myself, as it were, strongly prompted in my heart to dig in these writings, I followed this impulse with continual aspirations and persistent prayer to God for His help and divine illumination, if I was called to understand them. By reading in this manner again and again, and from time to time, I perceived that my heart felt well, and my understanding opened gradually; till at length I found what a treasure was hid in this field.”<br> 

            He set aside his pen and devoted 8 years to the study of Jacob Boehme. He leaves no record of the spiritual epiphany he experienced at this time, but by the time he resumed writing his doctrine had undergone a total transformation. The leaden legalism of his previous writing was transmuted to words of pure Spirit, like this passage from Christian Regeneration:

            "Some People have an Idea, or Notion of the Christian Religion, as if God was thereby declared so full of Wrath against fallen Man, that nothing but the Blood of his only begotten Son could satisfy his Vengeance.

            Nay, some have gone such Lengths of Wickedness, as to assert that God had by immutable Decrees reprobated, and rejected a great Part of the Race of Adam, to an inevitable Damnation, to show forth and magnify the Glory of his Justice.

            But these are miserable Mistakers of the Divine Nature, and miserable Reproachers of his great Love, and Goodness in the Christian Dispensation.

            For God is Love, yea, all Love, and so all Love, that nothing but Love can come from him; and the Christian Religion is nothing else but an open, full Manifestation of the universal Love towards all Mankind.

            As the Light of the Sun has only one common Nature towards all Objects that can receive it, so God has only one common Nature of Goodness towards all created Nature, breaking forth in infinite Flames of Love, upon every Part of the Creation, and calling everything to the highest Happiness it is capable of.

            God so loved Man, when his Fall was foreseen, that he chose him to Salvation in Christ Jesus, before the Foundation of the World. When Man was actually fallen, God was so without all Wrath towards him, so full of Love for him, that he sent his only begotten Son into the World to redeem him. Therefore God has no Nature towards Man, but Love, and all that he does to Man, is Love.

            There is no Wrath that stands between God and us, but what is awakened in the dark Fire of our own fallen Nature; and to quench this Wrath, and not his own, God gave his only begotten Son to be made Man. God has no more Wrath in himself now, than he had before the Creation, when he had only himself to love. The precious Blood of his Son was not poured out to pacify himself (who in himself had no Nature towards man but Love), but it was poured out, to quench the Wrath, and Fire of the fallen Soul, and kindle in it a Birth of Light, and Love. {See Spirit of Love, part ii, p. 50, &c.}

            As man lives, and moves, and has his Being in the Divine Nature, and is supported by it, whether his Nature be good or bad; so the Wrath of Man, which was awakened in the dark Fire of his fallen Nature, may, in a certain Sense, be called the Wrath of God, as Hell itself may be said to be in God, because nothing can be out of his Immensity; yet this Hell, is not God, but the dark Habitation of the Devil. And this Wrath which may be called the Wrath of God, is not God, but the fiery Wrath of the fallen Soul.

            And it was solely to quench this Wrath, awakened in the human Soul, that the Blood of the Son of God was necessary, because nothing but a Life and a Birth, derived from him into the human Soul, could change this darkened Root of a self-tormenting Fire, into an amiable Image of the holy Trinity, as it was at first created.

            This was the Wrath, Vengeance, and vindictive Justice that wanted to be satisfied, in order to our Salvation; it was the Wrath and Fire of Nature and Creature kindled only in itself, by its departing from true Resignation, and Obedience to God.

            When Adam and Eve went trembling behind the Trees, through Fear and Dread of God, it was only this Wrath of God awakened in them; it was a Terror, and Horror, and Shivering of Nature, that arose up in themselves, because the Divine Life, the Birth of the Son of God, which is the Brightness and Joy of the Soul, was departed from it, and had left it, to feel its own poor miserable State without it. And this may well enough be called the Wrath, and Justice of God upon them, because it was a Punishment, or painful State of the Soul, that necessarily followed their revolting from God.

            But still there was no Wrath, or painful Sensation, that wanted to be appeased, or satisfied, but in Nature and Creature; it was only the Wrath of fallen Nature, that wanted to be changed, into its first State of Peace and Love. When God spoke to them, he spoke only Love; Adam, where art thou? And he called him, only to comfort him with a promised Redemption, through a Seed of the Woman, a Spark of the word of Life which should reign in him, and his Posterity, till all Enemies were under their Feet. God therefore is all Love, and nothing but Love and Goodness can come from him. He is as far from Anger in himself, as from Pain and Darkness. But when the fallen Soul of Man, had awakened in itself, a wrathful, self-tormenting Fire, which could never be put out by itself, which could never be relieved by the natural Power of any Creature whatsoever, then the Son of God, by a Love, greater than that which created the World, became Man, and gave his own Blood, and Life into the fallen Soul, that it might through his Life in it, be raised, quickened, and born again into its first State of inward Peace and Delight, Glory and Perfection, never to be lost any more. O inestimable Truths! precious Mysteries, of the Love of God, enough to split the hardest Rock of the most obdurate Heart, that is but able to receive one Glimpse of them! Can the World resist such Love as this? 

            The "new" William Law drew a wider readership than ever but inevitably drew fire from the guardians of orthodoxy. To the astonishment of all, the once-upright churchman struck at the heart of Catholic/Protestant Christianity by repudiating the central doctrines of substitutionary atonement and transactional salvation. 

            "God was in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world to himself," that is, taking away from man every property, or power of evil, that kept him in a state of separation from God. Thus it was, and to this end, that "God was in Christ Jesus" in his whole process. 

            Unreasonably therefore have our scholastic systems of the gospel, separated the sacrifice of Christ's death, from the other parts of his process, and considered it as something chiefly done with regard to God, to alter, or atone an infinite wrath, that was raised in God against fallen man, which infinity of just vengeance, or vindictive justice, must have devoured the sinner, unless an infinite satisfaction had been made to it, by the death of Christ.

            All this is in the grossest ignorance of God, of the reason and ground, and effects of Christ's death, and in full contradiction to the express letter of scripture. For there we are told, that God is love, and that the infinity of his love was that alone, which showed itself towards fallen man, and wanted to have satisfaction done to it; which love-desire could not be fulfilled, could not be satisfied with anything less than man's full deliverance from all the evil of his fallen state.

            That love, which has the infinity of God, nay, which is God himself, was so immutably great towards man, though fallen from him, "that he spared not his only begotten Son"; and why did he not spare him? It was because nothing but the incarnate life of his eternal Son, passing through all the miserable states of lost man, could regenerate his first divine life in him.

            Can you possibly be told this, in stronger words than these, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son"; how did he give him? Why, in his whole process. And to what end did he give him? Why, "that all who believe in him, might not perish, but have everlasting life."

            Away then with the superstitious dream, of an infinite wrath in God towards poor fallen man, which could never cease, till an infinite satisfaction was made to it. All scripture denies it, and the light of nature abhors it. The birth, the life, the death of Christ, though so different things, have but one and the same operation, and that operation is solely in man, to drive all evil out of his fallen nature, and delight the heart of God, that desires his salvation. God is love, and has no other will towards man, but the will of love. That love, which from itself began the creation of an holy Adam, from itself began the redemption of a fallen Adam. The death of Christ was a sacrifice from the love of God the Son towards man, to overcome thereby that damnable death, which, otherwise, every son of Adam must have died; it was a sacrifice offered to the same love, in God the Father; a sacrifice, equally loved and desired by both of them, because, in the nature of the thing, as absolutely necessary to alter and overcome that evil, which belonged to man's state of death, as the incarnation of the WORD, was absolutely necessary in the nature of the thing, to make man to be alive again in God. <br>

            Law's loudest critic was his wayward disciple, John Wesley, founder of Methodism. 

            It is often claimed that Wesley was an admirer of Boehme and required all Methodists to read his books. This is incorrect. Wesley labeled his books "stark, staring nonsense" and Boehme himself a "Demonosopher." He did, however, acknowledge that JB was a "good man." So Boehme was a morally upright demoniac. So much for the Wesleyan analysis.<br>

            Three years after his death in 1761, the first of four volumes of the "William Law edition" of The Works of Jacob Behmen was published (which incited another round of attacks from Wesley). The collection proved to be his greatest legacy.

            His books were rescued from obscurity in 1896 when South African evangelist evangelist Andrew Murray published his "A Humble, Earnest and Affectionate Address to the Clergy" under the title You Will Receive Power, and revived again in the late 20th century by Norman Grubb.

                  <emphasis>There is only one Cross, a glorious historic Cross; </emphasis>only one Christ, an historic Christ; only one death, an historic death which he accomplished for me. But being my substitute, in fact if I am a believer, it was I there on the Cross. So I lean back on an accomplished fact. I reckon on the fact of my co-crucifixion and co-resurrection with my Lord Jesus Christ. The co-resurrection, of course, being by Another. The resurrection wasn't by the ability of Christ to rise from the dead;, because in infinite grace, taking our place as a man, He gave up His right to rise. He was a dead body. Another raised him from the dead, as Another comes and raises us from the dead; that indwelling Person of Romans 8. Thus we enter into Galatians 2:20. Now I am a crucified person so far as that independent ego is concerned. I am alive, so far as that little bit of an ego in which I was created is concerned. Inside that lives The Ego, the Self of all selves—Christ within. Now I live my life. 
                  <br>
                  Let us get this one thing straight; this is not that old confusing and mistaken idea that we humans are possessors of two natures and in a struggle between them, dog eating dog. This is the error, which puts us into the continuous condemnation of “we ought to be different.” Cut the words “ought to” out of our vocabulary. They belong to the law, which says you ought, and the law He has “taken out of the way, nailing it to His cross,” and has “abolished in His flesh the enmity, the law of commandments contained in ordinances.” Negatives are the opposite ends of their respective positives. So, we humans have not natures of our own, but we express the nature of the one who lives in us. Of old, as the old man, we expressed the nature of “the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience” so that we were “by nature the children of wrath” according to Ephesians 2:2-3.  As the new man is Christ, we are “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4), which is the Spirit of God bearing His own good fruit by us.
                  <br>  
                  Our confusion may be because I may feel it is all very well to talk of Christ living in me, but in practical fact, far more of me shows up than of Him! And it is all very well to say I was once a partaker of the satanic nature of self-centeredness and expressed him; but now I am a partaker of the divine nature and express Christ. But do I?  I have put off the old man and put on the new, it seems to me lots of the old man is still very evident! But that is where we need to get this “two nature” question sorted out, and this old man-new man syndrome.
                  <br>  
                  The confusion is between center and circumference. The center is the set of our lives; the circumference is what may temporarily influence us. In our old life, in “the old man,” our center was fixed, we being owned of the devil. We were slaves to him, Paul said in Romans 6:6-22. Now a slave is the property of his master; but no one can take from him his basic freedom. So, we may imagine a slave serving his master all day, then when his master is away somewhere at night, the salve well exercise his freedom by a visit to the market. He still remains a slave, but just goes his own way for a short while and returns to where he belongs.
                  <br>   
                  So now a slave of Satan can go and do a few good and religious things for a time, but that doesn’t change has basic slavery so equally a slave of Jesus can be tempted to exercise his human freedom in the ways of the flesh and does so, but back he comes to whom He belongs.
                  <br>
                  <br>   
                  <strong>We are what we are at our center, and our nature is the nature of the one who lives in us at the center. </strong> A temporary deviation does not alter that basic nature, but is just a diversion. When at the new birth Christ becomes our fixed center, we have begun to express His divine nature, though we may and so deviate into the flesh: but that does not alter the center. So just as a slave of the devil can do a few good things occasionally return to whom he belong, a slave of Christ can do a few bad things and return to whom he belongs. Do not mistake a deviation for a nature. We can never have two natures at once. Impossible. We are always pure at the center, in the sense of the word meaning unmixed. We were unmixed in our heart allegiance to Satan; thank God we are not unmixed in our allegiance to Christ. You cannot have a double mind or a double tongue (as James said of a fountain not being able to ‘send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter’). We have a single mind or tongue, but it can be temporarily diverted.  Call that double, if you like, but basically it is single.

We move back into where we’re free to serve, because we’re free!

                  There is a great deal of false condemnation. We mistake the temptations we all have for actual sin...and thus feel condemned. James clears that in 1:14-15. In Christ, as new creations, we accept ourselves delivered from that old sin-Satan indweller, and he replaced by our Christ-indweller. We are actually "made the righteousness of God in Him." (2 Cor. 5:21) But as only tempted and pressured selves, we do not mistake such soul-body assaults on us as sins committed producing condemnation. No, they are spurs to faith in our Christ-indweller and keeper! Sins are only (as in that James 1:15) when, from our spirit-center – our heart – we purposely follow a temptation into a committed sin, which is really rather rare. But, even then we are in temporary guilt, but not in condemnation. We are honest. We walk in the light...confess...agree with God about the sin committed. But when we have done that, John says, "He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" – consciousness of sin, and that is what it is here saying in 9:14, our consciences are cleansed from those "dead works". The precious blood has already blotted out the sins, but also now it cleanses from continued sense of condemnation. We do not live in condemnation! "There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus." (Rom. 8:1) We walk free and continue to walk free!
                    
                  The final of these four chapters (chapters 7-10) of our heavenly dimension in Christ is by the Intercessor – the restoration of the whole man in God. His shed blood removed the sins and their guilt consequences – "dead to sin" (1 Pet. 2:24). The offering of the body of Christ, His body representing us, was "made sin" (2 Cor. 5:2), just as ours contained the sin-indweller from the Fall; and in His body-death, as us, out went that sin-spirit of error and thus out of us, and in His resurrection in came His own "Spirit of Truth," and thus into us. So it now says, "We are sanctified (made holy, made whole) through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." "By one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified." Now that’s the whole man – the whole spirit, soul and body – perfectly God’s perfect agent. So we’re to see ourselves as perfect! The whole of us is caught up and transformed in the offering of the blood and the offering of the body. The whole man is back into its relationship in which we were created – to be sons with the Son.<br>
